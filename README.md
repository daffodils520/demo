MS2NMF (Submission Version)
===================

Description
-----------
This repository provides a submission-stage version of MS2NMF,
including a minimal reproducible demo for the NMF step and
a static web-based interface for method illustration.

## Directory Structure

```plaintext
MS2NMF/
├── README.md

``` 

## DATA
   - The `demo/` folder provides a pre-generated optimized fragment-intensity matrix (`demo_optimized_fragment_matrix.csv`) used as the direct input for NMF factorization.
The full preprocessing workflow is described in the manuscript, and all related
code and data will be released upon publication.
